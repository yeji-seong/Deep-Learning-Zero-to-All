# Learning rate <br>
Large learning rage : overshooting <br>
Small learning rate : 수렴 속도 느림, stops at local minimum <br><br>

#### Ways to setting learning rate <br>
=> Try several learning rates <br>
observe the cost function (ex) learning rate : 0.1 <br>
Check it goes down in a reasonable rate <br>

# Normalize <br>
Standardization <br>

# Overfitting <br>
training dataset에서는 잘 작동하지만, test dataset에서는 결과가 좋지 않음 <br><br>

#### Solutions for overfitting <br>
=> More training data <br><br>

=> Reduce the number of features <br><br>
